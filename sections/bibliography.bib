abstract = {Abstract Accurately identifying the soil map unit component at a specific point-location within a landscape is critical for implementing sustainable soil management. Recent developments in smartphone-based technologies for characterizing soil profiles, coupled with improved numerical soil classification algorithms, have made it more accessible for non-soil scientists to sample, characterize, and classify soil profiles. The main objective of this study was to evaluate an operational soil classification framework for identifying the soil component at a sampling-location based on the numerical similarity of soil property values between the sampled soil profile and the soil components mapped in that area. To evaluate this soil identification framework, we used a subset of the U.S. National Cooperative Soil Survey Soil Characterization Database (NCSS–SCD) as our soil profile test dataset and the U.S. Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database as our reference dataset using profile data of soil components in the area surrounding each test profile. Numerical similarity was tested using soil property data representing different degrees of generalization, both in terms of generalizing depth-wise variability (i.e., depth-support) and generalizing across feature space (i.e., soil properties). Three soil property groups (i.e., Novice, Expert, Expert-Plus) representing different levels of detail and three types of depth-support (i.e., genetic horizon, depth intervals, and depth functions) were evaluated. Using a simple set of soil property inputs (i.e., Novice: soil texture class, rock fragment volume class, and soil color) resulted in nearly as high identification accuracy (46–53\%) as that achieved with an Expert (48–57\%) dataset that included more precise determinations (percent sand, silt, clay, and rock fragment volume), and virtually no further improvement with the addition of pH and organic matter in the Expert-Plus dataset (53–60\%). This study also showed minimal effect from the type of depth-support used to represent depth-wise variability. Furthermore, we evaluated several measures of soil functional similarity (i.e., ecological sites, land capability, taxonomic distance) which resulted in management relevant accuracies ranging from 65–89\%. These findings support the utility of simple soil observations sampled at fixed depths for soil identification.},

   abstract = {This study examined spatial and temporal relationships between measured soil moisture and terrain-based proxies for soil moisture dynamics. Two catenas were intensively sampled reflecting a mosaic of differences in degree of soil development in California's Sierra Foothill Region. A catena containing weakly developed soils (Haploxerepts + Haploxeralfs) formed from granitic parent materials was compared to a catena of well-developed soils (Haploxeralfs and Palexeralfs) formed from metavolcanic parent materials. Soil moisture was monitored at 10-, 30-, and 50-cm depths in 15 profiles in the granitic catena and 100 profiles in the metavolcanic catena. Seven post-rainfall periods during the 2008-2009 water year were selected to compare terrain shape indices and measured soil moisture. No single terrain index (slope, tangential curvature, profile curvature, mean curvature, topographic prominence, terrain characterization index, and compound topographic index [CTI]) consistently described variability in mean water content or dry-down rates, across depth or space. However, within the granitic catena, a combination of CTI and modeled beam radiance consistently accounted for 30 to 70% of the total variance in mean water content at 10 cm, and 10 to 40% at 30- and 50-cm depths. The predictive capacity of digital elevation model (DEM)-derived terrain shape indices for soil moisture dynamics varied widely in time and space, and was influenced by spatial patterns in the degree of soil development. Efforts to describe soil moisture variability are an important attribute of digital soil mapping (DSM). Moreover, soil variability influences soil moisture dynamics, thus synergistic activities are needed to integrate landscape scale variability with digital soil mapping. © Soil Science Society of America, All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Soil colour is an important soil property. It is frequently used by soil scientists for the identification and classification of soil. It is also used as an indicator of field soil physical, chemical and biological properties as well as of the occurrence of soil processes. Measurements of soil colour are commonly made using the Munsell soil colour charts. A number of other colour space models, that overcome some of the limitations of the Munsell HVC system exist and may be used to more aptly describe soil colour. We looked at nine colour space models and a redness index: Munsell HVC, RGB, decorrelated RGB (DRGB), CIE XYZ, CIE Yxy, CIELAB, CIELUV, CIELHC, and Helmoltz chromaticity coordinates. The aims of this paper are to (i) describe the algorithms used for transformations between these colour space models, (ii) compare their representational qualities and their relationships to the Munsell soil colour system, and (iii) in a case study, determine the model best suited to describe the relationship between soil colour and soil organic carbon. The type of colour model to use will depend on the purpose. For example, if soil colour is being used for merely descriptive purposes, then the Munsell HVC system will remain appropriate; if it is being used for numerical statistical or predictive analysis, as in our case study, then colour models that use Cartesian-type coordinate systems will be more useful. Of these, the CIELUV and CIELCH models appear to be more suitable for predictions of soil organic carbon.}

abstract="Published soil survey reports typically describe soil series concepts in the form of aggregated information: ranges in soil properties, interpretations, and limitations that are derived from a collection of field-described soil profiles. While aggregated soil properties are readily estimated via standard statistical functions (mean, median, etc.), an aggregated representation of horizonation (e.g., genetic or functional horizon designation and depth) is typically difficult to construct. Variation in horizon designation use among soil scientists and different soil description systems, changes in horizon designation standards over time, variable depths at which horizons occur, and the uncertainties associated with these are all factors that complicate the process of delivering an aggregated representation of horizonation. In this chapter, we propose alternatives to the typical ``representative profile,'' e.g., the selection of a single soil profile to represent a collection. Two possible methods for aggregating a collection of soil profiles into synthetic profiles are presented, describing depth-wise probability functions for each horizon. Both methods rely on an expert-guided description of generalized horizon designation (e.g., a subset of horizon designation labels that convey a reasonable ``morphologic story'') along with associated rules (regular expression patterns) used to correlate field-described to generalized horizon designation. The first method is based on (1-cm interval) slice-wise evaluation of generalized horizon designation; the second is based on a proportional-odds logistic regression model fit to depth-slices. These methods are demonstrated using USDA-NRCS soil survey data (USA).",

  Abstract                 = {Inspired by the catena concept, we returned to the landscape of origin for this idea in central Uganda and applied quantitative soil–landscape-modeling techniques to the study of soil formation. In particular, we employed Generalized Least Squares (GLS) regression to identify potential terrain (and other) controls on surface texture with the goal of explaining texture contrast formation for well-drained red soils, and fluvial deposition for yellow–gray lowland soils. Well-drained red soils and poorly drained yellow–gray soils were identified using a high-resolution spectroradiometer and soil redness was highly correlated with a measure of elevation above the valley floor. For the yellow–gray soils, sand content and sand grain size increased with greater slope gradient and in converging areas—evidence supporting fluvial control of surface soil composition. For red soils, texture contrast increased on lower backslopes, decreased over ferricrete-rich parent material, and had no significant association with either infiltration- or runoff-influenced locations. Surprisingly, texture contrast was also reduced or even inverted on fine scale convexities (&lt;18 m in diameter). These findings were consistent with the following theoretical processes: (1) sand deposition on lower-backslopes, increasing texture contrast; (2) ferricrete weathering at the soil surface, reducing texture contrast; and (3) texture contrast inversion through termite turbation. A number of techniques proved useful in this study: (a) the use of \{GLS\} regression supported the interpretation of model coefficients in an explicitly spatial context; (b) thin-plate splines provided a flexible means of controlling the spatial scale of terrain index computation; and (c) the development of a new downslope-looking Elevation Above Stream (EASy) terrain index provided a powerful tool for the identification of poorly drained soils—a tool that could have applications in a variety of landscapes and environments. Overall, we found that the catena concept as a soil–terrain-modeling approach worked best on lower, less well-drained, depositional landscape components. For the well-drained portion of this landscape, there was little evidence to suggest that soil formation was controlled by hillslope hydrology as proposed by the catena concept. The catena concept interpreted in a broad sense challenges pedologists to explicitly link soil geographic patterns with specific soil forming processes and environmental controls—an approach that proved valuable in this study. },

This study was conducted to determine whether color measurements with a colorimeter could be employed to identify Fe oxides and hydroxysulfates, either as monomineralic samples or in soils. We measured the color of 277 Fe oxide and hydroxysulfate mineral samples, as well as 309 soils and soil fractions. Discriminant analysis was employed to separate the minerals in three different color systems: CIE-Yxy, CIE-L*a*b*, and Munsell. Using the color of monomineralic samples, 100% of maghemites and jarosites could be correctly classified, 95% of goethites, 90% of feroxyhites, 84% of lepidocrocites, 83% of hematites, 56% of ferrihydrites, 50% of akaganeites, and 44% of schwertmannites. In soil samples, goethite (90% correct classifications) could be reliably distinguished from hematite-goethite mixtures (82% correct classifications), and from lepidocrocite-goethite mixtures (89%). The identification of ferrihydrites, akaganeites, and schwertmannites largely failed because of similar average colors and because of high color variability. Because the color variability is a mineral-intrinsic property rather than produced by errors of measurement, color is in principle unsuited for identifying ferrihydrites, akaganeites, and schwertmannites. However, color may be used to identify goethite, hematite, lepidocrocite, jarosite, maghemite, and feroxyhite with a relatively high reliability. The choice of color system is not crucial for this type of analysis.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate soil color measurements to predict SOC for agriculture and prairie land uses. Munsell soil color book (B) and chroma meter (C) color readings were taken at the midpoint depth of each horizon (HB and HC) and predetermined depth increments (IB and IC) on 125 cores. Horizon matrix (HD) colors were determined by standard description. A chroma meter was used to determine the color of prepared samples, ground to <2 mm. Both color data sets were used in a regression analysis to predict SOC content by weight and volume. The best predictors for each technique are the models that incorporate Munsell value and chroma along with the depth from which the measurement was taken. Separating samples by land use improved the prediction of SOC. Transforming SOC content by log10 improved the coefficient of determination for nearly all models. The best predictors of SOC were HD for SOC by weight (agricultural field r2 = 0.79, prairie r2 = 0.53), HB for SOC by volume (agricultural field r2 = 0.76, prairie r2 = 0.57), and IC and IB for log-transformed SOC by weight and volume (agricultural field r2 = 0.84, prairie r2 = 0.62). This study indicates that while SOC content predictions can be made with field measurements, there are limitations to their predictive usefulness.},

   abstract = {Rapid low cost methods to quantify soil C concentrations are needed to support local through global resource inventories. Color is a key indicator of many soil properties, with a strong linkage between darkness and soil organic matter (SOM), making it an important indicator for soil taxonomy, soil quality, and fertility. This study investigated relationships between quantitative measurements of soil color and C in ~1900 forest soil samples, representing a wide range of soil development, parent material (PM), and C concentrations. Utilizing a hand held chromameter and the CIELAB color space, soil darkness (L) was employed as a continuous predictor of C in simple models (C ~ darkness) with a slope ~ -0.1 across the entire population. Grouping samples by taxonomy and PM influenced model coefficients with strong correlation in weakly developed soil groups (Inceptisols r = -0.9) and more felsic PM. Soil redness (A) has a strong influence on model performance, altering slope and increasing data scatter. Including redness in multivariate relationships greatly increased fit, aligning model slopes at -0.1 for all PM. Ordinary least squares models reached predictive accuracy of  < 0.5% (RMSE) for specific soils, certain PM classes, and in samples with  < 4% C. These results demonstrate the utility of quantified soil color to drive predictive relationships and support data development to refine ecosystem C budgets and quantify soil C credits. © Soil Science Society of America.

	abstract = {As societies move toward nature-based infrastructure to provide ecosystem services for sustainable urban environmental management, knowledge of urban soils remains a critical gap. An 11-city comparison of urban to reference preurban soil profiles revealed how urbanization modifies the presence and ordering of soil layers and its properties. Urban soils had fewer horizons than their preurban counterparts, with a predominant absence of intermediate B horizons. The loss of B horizons, which are not easily replaced, as they form over decades to millennia, can affect ecosystem functions, with potentially wide-ranging consequences for ecosystem services in cities.Soils support terrestrial ecosystem function and therefore are critical urban infrastructure for generating ecosystem services. Urbanization processes modify ecosystem function by changing the layers of soils identified as soil horizons. Soil horizons are integrative proxies for suites of soil properties and as such can be used as an observable unit to track modifications within soil profiles. Here, in an analysis of 11 cities representing 10 of the 12 soil orders, we show that urban soils have \~{}50\% fewer soil horizons than preurban soils. Specifically, B horizons were much less common in urban soils and were replaced by a deepening of A horizons and a shallowing of C horizons. This shift is likely due to two processes: (i) local management, i.e., soil removal, mixing, and fill additions, and (ii) soil development timelines, i.e., urbanized soils are young and have had short time periods for soil horizon development since urbanization (decades to centuries) relative to soil formation before urbanization (centuries to millennia). Urban soils also deviated from the standard A-B-C horizon ordering at a much greater frequency than preurban soils. Overall, our finding of common shifts in urban soil profiles across soil orders and cities suggests that urban soils may function differently from their preurban antecedents. This work introduces a basis for improving our understanding of soil modifications by urbanization and its potential effects on ecosystem functioning and thereby has implications for ecosystem services derived from urban landscapes.},

abstract = {Parametric and non-parametric depth functions have been used to estimate continuous soil profile properties. However, some soil properties, such as those seen in weathered loess, have anisotropic peak-shaped depth distributions. These distributions are poorly handled by common parametric functions. And while nonparametric functions can handle this data they lack meaningful parameters to describe physical phenomena in the depth distribution of a property such as a peak, an inflection point, or a gradient. The objective of this work is to introduce the use of asymmetric peak functions to model complex and anisotropic soil property depth profiles. These functions have the advantages of providing parameters, which quantify or describe pedogenic processes. We demonstrate the application of the Pearson Type IV (PIV) and the logistic power peak (LPP) functions to high resolution soil property depth profiles measured by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in a claypan soil landscape of Northeastern Missouri, USA. Both peak functions successfully fit clay, silt, and pH data for an example soil profile from a summit landscape position (R2=0.90 for pH and 0.98 for silt and clay). The LPP function was further demonstrated to fit clay depth distribution for a shoulder, backslope, footslope, and a depositional landscape position (R2=0.98, 0.96, 0.96, 0.91). Relationships between the fitted parameters of these profiles were useful to describe landscape trends in their morphological features and show promise to continuously describe pedogenic processes in three dimensions. Peak functions are a useful companion to high-resolution soil profile data collected by sensors and their combined use may allow more intensive mapping and better explanation of soil landscape variability.}

abstract = {Abstract A comparative study was made of the function of the interaction of the hue and chroma color components on the genetic or developmental color in seven well-drained soil profiles arrayed across a Chestnut-Chernozem-Brunizem soil climosequence. Earlier attempts to assess the aspect of developmental color associated with hue and chroma on the basis of hue alone or chroma alone have not proven satisfactory, especially in grassland soils. The numerical method used in this study involves the interaction of the hue and chroma components. Quantitative numerical color-development equivalents were obtained for the individual horizons in each profile studied. This made possible the graphic portrayal of the color-development profile which in turn facilitated the direct comparison of the distribution and magnitude of the developmental color in the profiles in the climosequence. Among the profiles studied, characteristic color-development curves were obtained for the Chestnut, Chernozem, and Brunizem profiles as well as for the intergradational profiles. The curves obtained appear to comprise an evolutionary sequence of color development across the climosequence of the grassland soils used in this study.},

This index, which combines eight soil field properties with soil thickness, is designed from field descriptions of the Merced River chronosequence in central California. These eight properties are: clay films, texture plus wet consistence, rubification (color hue and chroma), structure, dry consistence, moist consistence, color value, and pH. Other properties described in the field can be added when more soils are studied. Most of the properties change systematically within the 3 m.y. age span of the Merced River chronosequence. The absence of properties on occasion does not significantly affect the index. Individual quantified field properties, as well as the integrated index, are examined and compared as functions of soil depth and age.}

The most obvious morphological change in the soil across Mollisol hydrosequences in Minnesota is the thickening and darkening of the A horizon(s). Our purpose is to quantify this trend across the landscape and examine its correlation with duration of saturated and/or reducing conditions for distinguishing between hydric and nonhydric Mollisols. We examined trends in soil morphology and soil organic C in conjunction with hydrologic monitoring data across three Mollisol hydrosequences. We defined a new color index that is a function of the thickness and color of the A horizon(s) of Mollisols of three hillslopes in Minnesota. Coefficients of correlation (r) between this index and duration of saturated and reducing conditions at various depths in these Mollisols are as high as 0.69. This index is also linearly related to organic C content of the A horizon(s) of a single hillslope with a coefficient of correlation of 0.98. This index may be useful for identifying and delineating hydric soils and may be employed to examine soil C storage at a landscape scale; however, specific relationships will vary considerably with soil parent material and climate.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Expert systems and numerical classification in general are reviewed and their relative ability to improve soil classification systems are discussed. The inductive and deductive elements of expert systems are seen as corresponding to the class establishment and class assignment phases of classification; computerized expert systems have so far been set up only for very simple assignments. To date, numerical classification has been useful in the analysis and organization of local low-level soil data but has been largely untried at the higher global levels of soil classification because of a lack of suitable data and scientific commitment. It is concluded that numerical classification has a potentially useful part to play in establishing soil classes and generating rules for assignment in expert systems. The inference procedures and user interface of expert systems should allow more integration and realistic assignment of available data and increase the usefulness and predictability of soil information, especially if presented in a user-friendly mode.},

  abstract = {The movement towards precision agriculture has led to calls for soil
	maps that are more detailed and accurate than those offered in standard
	NCSS soil surveys. Studies have shown that soil variability can be
	greater than depicted in soil surveys; in fact, delineations that
	contain at least 50% of the soil mapped are considered satisfactory
	for soil survey purposes. Lacustrine plains are relatively flat and
	often have parent materials with uniform properties. Because soils
	are usually mapped using soil-landform relationships one might expect
	soil maps in these areas to be less accurate than average; it is
	difficult to delineate between map units using soil-landform relationships
	in such subtle landscapes. We grid-mapped a field containing lacustrine-derived
	soils in central Iowa and used the grid to evaluate the soil survey
	for accuracy. Two major and two minor soils, as determined by the
	area they occupy in the field, were present. For the field as a whole,
	the two major soils were correctly identified by the soil survey
	at least 63% of the time. The two minor soils were correctly identified
	33% of the time or less by the soil survey. Large-scale soil mapping
	is expensive because of the time involved to create them in the field
	and in the office. Therefore, it is only economically beneficial
	to produce a detailed map if the map leads to significant alterations
	in the way a field is managed. In fields that may have uniform soil
	properties, it may be more cost-effective to conduct a reconnaissance
	survey first and then decide if more detailed mapping is required.},

  Abstract                 = {The 1:50,000 national soil survey of the Netherlands, completed in the early 1990s after more than three decades of mapping, is gradually becoming outdated. Large-scale changes in land and water management that took place after the field surveys have had a great impact on the soil. Especially oxidation of peat soils has resulted in a substantial decline of these soils. The aim of this research was to update the national soil map for the province of Drenthe (2680 km2) without additional fieldwork through digital soil mapping using legacy soil data. Multinomial logistic regression was used to quantify the relationship between ancillary variables and soil group. Special attention was given to model-building as this is perhaps the most crucial step in digital soil mapping. A framework for building a logistic regression model was taken from the literature and adapted for the purpose of soil mapping. The model-building process was guided by pedological expert knowledge to ensure that the final regression model is not only statistically sound but also pedologically plausible. We built separate models for the ten major map units, representing the main soil groups, of the national soil map for the province of Drenthe. The calibrated models were used to estimate the probability of occurrence of soil groups on a 25 m grid. Shannon entropy was used to quantify the uncertainty of the updated soil map, and the updated soil map was validated by an independent probability sample. The theoretical purity of the updated map was 67\%. The estimated actual purity of the updated map, as assessed by the validation sample, was 58\%, which is 6\% larger than the actual purity of the national soil map. The discrepancy between theoretical and actual purity might be explained by the spatial clustering of the soil profile observations used to calibrate the multinomial logistic regression models and by the age difference between calibration and validation observations.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Digital soil morphometrics is defined as the application of tools and techniques for measuring and quantifying soil profile attributes and deriving continuous depth functions. This paper reviews how proximal soil sensing and other tools can be used in soil profile descriptions where techniques and toolkits have not changed in the past decades. The application of such tools is compared to standard soil profile descriptions for 11 common attributes: horizons, texture, color, structure, moisture, mottles, consistence, carbonates, rock fragments, pores and roots. These attributes are extensively used in soil classification and are indicative of many soil functions. There has been progress in distinguishing soil horizons, texture and soil color, mainly using visâ€“NIR, \{GPR\} and electrical resistivity. There is potential for in situ digital morphometrics for all attributes of a soil profile. Smaller depth increments can be sampled and analyzed, and that gives continuous depth functions of soil properties. The combined use of in situ digital morphometrics and continuous depth functions of soil properties may enhance our pedological understanding. It will take time before the toolbox of the field pedologists will be digitally enriched, but we think that digital soil morphometrics has the potential to complement existing description and analytical methods. It may yield new insights in soil horizonation, how soils form and how they could be classified.},
