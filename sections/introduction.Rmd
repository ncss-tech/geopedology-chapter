## Abstract

The Algorithms for Quantitative Pedology (AQP) project is a suite of packages for the R programming language that simplify quantitative analysis of soil profile data. The "aqp" package provides a vocabulary (functions and data structures) tailored to the complexity of soil profile information. The "soilDB" package provides interfaces to databases and web services; leveraging the "aqp" vocabulary. The "sharpshootR" package provides tools to assist with summary and visualization. Bridging the gap between pedometric theory and practice is central to the purpose of the AQP project. The AQP R packages have been extensively tested and documented, applied to projects involving hundreds of thousands of soil profiles, and integrated into widely used tools such as SoilWeb. These packages serve an important role in routine data analysis within the U.S. Department of Agriculture and in other soil survey programs across the world.

## Introduction

<!-- brief history, naming, related suite of packages -->

There has never been a time in the history of soil science where data (soil morphology, physical, chemical, mineralogical, etc.) have been so widely available, and, so closely tied to points on the ground (i.e. GPS coordinates) or high-resolution soil survey databases. However, data alone cannot support decisions or practical advice to land managers. The myriad data sources, formats, and conventions (even within a single institution) further complicate the scientist's or soil surveyor's best efforts to synthesize something useful from a mountain of data. While these problems aren't new (50 hand-written soil profile descriptions would have been difficult to reason over before computers), tools that link database APIs, spatial data, and the inherently complex nature of a soil description are now viable thanks to programming environments like R [@R].


The Algorithms for Quantitative Pedology (AQP) project is a suite of packages for the R programming language that simplify most facets of soil data analysis. This project began (2006-2008) as a loosely coordinated (direct email correspondence and the *r-help* mailing list) collection of R scripts used to support the management, analysis, and visualization of digital soil morphology records. By 2010 it became clear that an R package (code, manual pages, and example data following strict guidlines) hosted by CRAN would be the best route forward. Since
