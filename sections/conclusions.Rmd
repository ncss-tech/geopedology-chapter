*Geopedology*....can/should we use this for the first time here!!  see if we can briefly work it into another section so this is not the first use of it.

Complex data structures and increasing volumes of available data demand progress in methods that allow iterative aggregation, summary and graphical expression of soil data. The *aqp* suite of packages works to provide examples and routines that meet these challenges with an an emphasis on generalized methods that can be applied to common data structures that are designed for analytical efficiency.  This collection of tools leverages the flexibility and extensibility of the R programming environment and enables logical checks of data, profile sketches, color conversion, aggregation, numerical classification and synthesis across various sources of soil survey data.   

Operational soil mapping and inventory is inherently a visual discipline of soil science and pedology. Conveying the relevancy and context of soil survey information and how that information can be integrated with other environmental data is critical to educating the public about the soil resource.  An understanding of the geomorphic context through the linkage of *geopedologic* concepts to soil survey remains a vital operational part of soil survey methodology.  New tools allow for new possibilities in products and lead to greater use of soil survey data......
