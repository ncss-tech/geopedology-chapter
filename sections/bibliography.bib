abstract = {Abstract Accurately identifying the soil map unit component at a specific point-location within a landscape is critical for implementing sustainable soil management. Recent developments in smartphone-based technologies for characterizing soil profiles, coupled with improved numerical soil classification algorithms, have made it more accessible for non-soil scientists to sample, characterize, and classify soil profiles. The main objective of this study was to evaluate an operational soil classification framework for identifying the soil component at a sampling-location based on the numerical similarity of soil property values between the sampled soil profile and the soil components mapped in that area. To evaluate this soil identification framework, we used a subset of the U.S. National Cooperative Soil Survey Soil Characterization Database (NCSS–SCD) as our soil profile test dataset and the U.S. Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database as our reference dataset using profile data of soil components in the area surrounding each test profile. Numerical similarity was tested using soil property data representing different degrees of generalization, both in terms of generalizing depth-wise variability (i.e., depth-support) and generalizing across feature space (i.e., soil properties). Three soil property groups (i.e., Novice, Expert, Expert-Plus) representing different levels of detail and three types of depth-support (i.e., genetic horizon, depth intervals, and depth functions) were evaluated. Using a simple set of soil property inputs (i.e., Novice: soil texture class, rock fragment volume class, and soil color) resulted in nearly as high identification accuracy (46–53\%) as that achieved with an Expert (48–57\%) dataset that included more precise determinations (percent sand, silt, clay, and rock fragment volume), and virtually no further improvement with the addition of pH and organic matter in the Expert-Plus dataset (53–60\%). This study also showed minimal effect from the type of depth-support used to represent depth-wise variability. Furthermore, we evaluated several measures of soil functional similarity (i.e., ecological sites, land capability, taxonomic distance) which resulted in management relevant accuracies ranging from 65–89\%. These findings support the utility of simple soil observations sampled at fixed depths for soil identification.},

abstract = {Soil colour is an important soil property. It is frequently used by soil scientists for the identification and classification of soil. It is also used as an indicator of field soil physical, chemical and biological properties as well as of the occurrence of soil processes. Measurements of soil colour are commonly made using the Munsell soil colour charts. A number of other colour space models, that overcome some of the limitations of the Munsell HVC system exist and may be used to more aptly describe soil colour. We looked at nine colour space models and a redness index: Munsell HVC, RGB, decorrelated RGB (DRGB), CIE XYZ, CIE Yxy, CIELAB, CIELUV, CIELHC, and Helmoltz chromaticity coordinates. The aims of this paper are to (i) describe the algorithms used for transformations between these colour space models, (ii) compare their representational qualities and their relationships to the Munsell soil colour system, and (iii) in a case study, determine the model best suited to describe the relationship between soil colour and soil organic carbon. The type of colour model to use will depend on the purpose. For example, if soil colour is being used for merely descriptive purposes, then the Munsell HVC system will remain appropriate; if it is being used for numerical statistical or predictive analysis, as in our case study, then colour models that use Cartesian-type coordinate systems will be more useful. Of these, the CIELUV and CIELCH models appear to be more suitable for predictions of soil organic carbon.}

  abstract = {The movement towards precision agriculture has led to calls for soil
	maps that are more detailed and accurate than those offered in standard
	NCSS soil surveys. Studies have shown that soil variability can be
	greater than depicted in soil surveys; in fact, delineations that
	contain at least 50% of the soil mapped are considered satisfactory
	for soil survey purposes. Lacustrine plains are relatively flat and
	often have parent materials with uniform properties. Because soils
	are usually mapped using soil-landform relationships one might expect
	soil maps in these areas to be less accurate than average; it is
	difficult to delineate between map units using soil-landform relationships
	in such subtle landscapes. We grid-mapped a field containing lacustrine-derived
	soils in central Iowa and used the grid to evaluate the soil survey
	for accuracy. Two major and two minor soils, as determined by the
	area they occupy in the field, were present. For the field as a whole,
	the two major soils were correctly identified by the soil survey
	at least 63% of the time. The two minor soils were correctly identified
	33% of the time or less by the soil survey. Large-scale soil mapping
	is expensive because of the time involved to create them in the field
	and in the office. Therefore, it is only economically beneficial
	to produce a detailed map if the map leads to significant alterations
	in the way a field is managed. In fields that may have uniform soil
	properties, it may be more cost-effective to conduct a reconnaissance
	survey first and then decide if more detailed mapping is required.},

  Abstract                 = {The 1:50,000 national soil survey of the Netherlands, completed in the early 1990s after more than three decades of mapping, is gradually becoming outdated. Large-scale changes in land and water management that took place after the field surveys have had a great impact on the soil. Especially oxidation of peat soils has resulted in a substantial decline of these soils. The aim of this research was to update the national soil map for the province of Drenthe (2680 km2) without additional fieldwork through digital soil mapping using legacy soil data. Multinomial logistic regression was used to quantify the relationship between ancillary variables and soil group. Special attention was given to model-building as this is perhaps the most crucial step in digital soil mapping. A framework for building a logistic regression model was taken from the literature and adapted for the purpose of soil mapping. The model-building process was guided by pedological expert knowledge to ensure that the final regression model is not only statistically sound but also pedologically plausible. We built separate models for the ten major map units, representing the main soil groups, of the national soil map for the province of Drenthe. The calibrated models were used to estimate the probability of occurrence of soil groups on a 25 m grid. Shannon entropy was used to quantify the uncertainty of the updated soil map, and the updated soil map was validated by an independent probability sample. The theoretical purity of the updated map was 67\%. The estimated actual purity of the updated map, as assessed by the validation sample, was 58\%, which is 6\% larger than the actual purity of the national soil map. The discrepancy between theoretical and actual purity might be explained by the spatial clustering of the soil profile observations used to calibrate the multinomial logistic regression models and by the age difference between calibration and validation observations.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Digital soil morphometrics is defined as the application of tools and techniques for measuring and quantifying soil profile attributes and deriving continuous depth functions. This paper reviews how proximal soil sensing and other tools can be used in soil profile descriptions where techniques and toolkits have not changed in the past decades. The application of such tools is compared to standard soil profile descriptions for 11 common attributes: horizons, texture, color, structure, moisture, mottles, consistence, carbonates, rock fragments, pores and roots. These attributes are extensively used in soil classification and are indicative of many soil functions. There has been progress in distinguishing soil horizons, texture and soil color, mainly using visâ€“NIR, \{GPR\} and electrical resistivity. There is potential for in situ digital morphometrics for all attributes of a soil profile. Smaller depth increments can be sampled and analyzed, and that gives continuous depth functions of soil properties. The combined use of in situ digital morphometrics and continuous depth functions of soil properties may enhance our pedological understanding. It will take time before the toolbox of the field pedologists will be digitally enriched, but we think that digital soil morphometrics has the potential to complement existing description and analytical methods. It may yield new insights in soil horizonation, how soils form and how they could be classified.},
