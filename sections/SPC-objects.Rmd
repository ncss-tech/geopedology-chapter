## SPC

  * rationale
  * basic design / strategy
  * various back-ends

### Subsetting

  * `[`-methods, `.FIRST` style keywords, spatial predicates (Andrew)
  * `subset()` and NSE (Andrew)
  * `glom()`, `trunc()` and related (Andrew) 
  * other methods

### Iteration

  * implicit vectorization
  * `profileApply()` (Andrew)

### Misc.

 * data cleaning, fixing, validity, etc. (Andrew)
 * functions that return SPC objects via soilDB (Dylan, Jay, Stephen)
